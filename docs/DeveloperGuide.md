## **1. Introduction**

Baymax is a desktop appointment manager made for clinic receptionists. It focuses on the Command Line Interface (CLI) while providing users with a simple and intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). Thus, the main interaction with Baymax will be done through user text-based commands.

Baymax allows receptionists to keep track of patients and appointments in a single, integrated platform.

The purpose of this Developer Guide is to help you understand the design and implementation of Baymax, so that you can become a contributor to this project as well.

## **2. Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3. Design**

In this section, you will learn about the general design and structure of the Baymax application. This section explains how each component in Baymax works individually. Baymax is created with the Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm in mind, and follows the Facade Pattern and Command Pattern in software design.

### **3.1 Architecture**

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

Figure 1. Architecture Diagram of Baymax
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.
</div>

The following table provides a quick overview of each component of Baymax. More details about each individual component can be found in the following subsections.

| Component | Description
| --------- | ------------------------------------------
| `Main`    | Has two classes called Main and MainApp.<br><br> It is responsible for: <br>1. At App launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other. <br>2. At shut down: Shuts down the components and cleanup resources where necessary.
| `Commons` | Represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. <br><br>It also contains the LogCenter component. The LogCenter component plays an important role at the architectural level and is used by many classes to write log messages to the App’s log file.
| `UI`      | Handles the UI of the App.
| `Logic`   | Executes commands.
| `Model`   | Holds the data of the App in memory.
| `Storage` | Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletepatient 1`.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2. UI component
(Contributed by Li Jianhan)

This segment will explain the structure and responsibilities of the `UI` component.

#### 3.2.1. Structure
![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)<br>
Figure 4. Structure of the UI component

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/team/baymax/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts such as the `CommandBox` and `SideTabPane` as shown in the *Class Diagram* above. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `SideTabPane` class creates `XYZPage` corresponding to each tab in the GUI. Each tab will display information on different features of Baymax. The `XYZPage` is a generic name given to the following elements:
- Dashboard
- PatientInfoPage
- AppointmentInfoPage
- CalendarPage
- SchedulePage
- InfoPage

Each of these classes (except InfoPage) displays data from the `Model` to the user.
For example, The PatientInfoPage and AppointmentInfoPage display lists of patients and appointments respectively. Hence they contain `XYZListPanel` (shown in the diagram below), which in turn contains a collection of `XYZCard` that displays each data field in the Patient and Appointment class.

![Structure of an XYZPage](images/UiXYZPageClassDiagram.png)<br>

#### 3.2.2. Responsibilities

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### 3.3. Logic component

This segment will explain the structure and responsibilities of the Logic component.

#### 3.3.1 Structure

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)<br>
Figure 5. Structure of the Logic Component

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/team/baymax/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AppointmentBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an appointment, which is executed by the `ModelManager`, calling on AppointmentManager).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
5. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user and jumping to relevant tabs.

#### 3.3.2 Responsibilities

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("cancel 1")` API call.

### 3.4. Model component
(Contributed by Kaitlyn Ng & Reuben Teng)

This segment will explain the structure and responsibilities of the Model component.

#### 3.4.1. Structure
![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)
Figure 7. Structure of the Model Component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/team/baymax/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component contains `ListManager`s that handle two main types of data in Baymax, `Patient` and `Appointment`. 
Each type of data is handled by a separate `ListManager` (`PatientManager` and `AppointmentManager`). A `ModelManager` facade class then exposes the methods 
that enable other components to perform getting, setting, searching and editing functions on the different 
types of data.

Apart from `ListManager`s, the `Model` component also contains a `CalendarManager` that manages an `AppointmentCalendar`. The `CalendarManager` supports operations on the `AppointmentCalendar` such as getting and setting the `year`, `month` and `day`. 

The `Model` component also contains

* a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* unmodifiable `ObservableList` objects for each type of data that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this 
  list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change. 
  
The `Model` component does not depend on any of the other three components.

#### 3.4.2. Responsibilities

The `Model` component,

* Stores different types of data in memory when Baymax is running
* Represents data in `ObservableList` to automatically update the GUI when there is a change

### 3.5. Storage component

This segment will explain the structure and responsibilities of the Storage component.

#### 3.5.1. Structure
![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)
Figure 8. Structure of the Storage Component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/team/baymax/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component contains interfaces for `Patient` data (`PatientManagerStorage`) and 
`Appointment` data (`AppointmentManagerStorage`) which defines methods for reading and saving the `Model` components
to memory. This allows for multiple different implementations of storage to store the data in different formats, e.g. 
json, csv, plaintext. A facade class `StorageManager` is used to expose these reading and writing methods.

The `JsonPatientManagerStorage` and `JsonAppointmentManagerStorage` are specific implementations of 
`PatientManagerStorage` and `AppointmentManagerStorage` that saves the `Patient` and `Appointment` data to 
json files. The path to these files are obtained from the `UserPref` object. 

#### 3.5.2. Responsibilities

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format.
* can parse a json file in the correct format to get a `UserPref` object.  
* can save `Patient` and `Appointment` data in json format. 
* can parse a json file in the correct format to get a `PatientManager` or `AppointmentManager` object.

### 3.6. Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `team.baymax.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **4. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### **4.1 List Managers**
(Contributed by Kaitlyn Ng)

List Managers allow the Baymax application to handle lists of the different types of data in the application, 
namely `Patient` and `Appointment`. `ListManager` defines methods for Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations 
that are common to all the types of data, and needed to manage the lists of data effectively. 

#### 4.1.1 Rationale
The separation of `Patient` and `Appointment` data into separate ListManagers allow for a common software architecture 
between data types. Lists of data within the application can thus be handled more efficiently, and other types of data 
can be added to extend the application with minimal modification to the code.

#### 4.1.2. Current Implementation

Each `ListManager`contains a `UniqueList` which is a generic class that stores all the data items in a list and
and maintains the uniqueness of the data objects in the list while doing so. This ensures that in every `UniqueList`, 
there is only one of each object. The `UniqueList` class is a generic class that can only contain data items that 
extend the `UniqueListElement` interface, which ensures data items contain the necessary comparison functions for 
`UniqueList` to maintain uniqueness. 

Each ListManager implements the `ReadOnlyListManager` interface. This interface has the `getReadOnlyList()` method 
which returns an `ObservableList` of data items, to be monitored by the GUI.

An example of a the `ListManager` implementation is shown below using the `PatientManager` class, that manages a
`UniqueList` of `Patient`s. A similar structure is implemented for the `AppointmentManager` class, that manages a 
`UniqueList` of `Appointment`s.

![Structure of PatientManager](images/PatientManagerClassDiagram.png)<br>
Figure 8. Structure of PatientManager

**API** : [`PatientManager.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/team/baymax/model/modelmanagers/PatientManager.java)


#### 4.1.3. Design Consideration
**Aspect: Separation into distinct list managers for each type of data.**

|                                                                | Pros                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Cons                                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Option 1 (Current Choice): Split into separate lists (Current)                  | Increases modularity of the code by separating it into distinct sections to handle data whose  operations do not often require interaction  between them.  <br><br>Allows for more straightforward implementations in other components by ensuring each data type is handled with the class architecture. | A lot of boilerplate code for implementing  the list managers as separate classes  but with similar functionalities                               |
| Option 2: Store all the information in a single  `DataManager` | Easier to implement, as only one manager class is needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Violates the Separation of Concerns principle, making it difficult to implement future extensions without significant change to other components. |
  
<br>Reason for choosing Option 1:

Sound design principles are key to ensuring that the program is bug-free, easily testable and easily extendable in the 
future. Option 1 increases modularity of the code to create more opportunities for module upgrade, reuse and
<br>independent development for each data type, limiting the amount of change needed to other components when there are
changes in the `Model`. This will save time in the long run and reduce the possibility of introducing breaking bugs due
to unnecessary dependencies between data types.

**Aspect 2: Extract common CRUD operations with a generic class**

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Pros                                                                                                                                                                           | Cons                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Option 1 (Current Choice): Extract common CRUD functionalities of the `ListManager`s into a single `UniqueList` class. The `ListManager`s will store data items in the `UniqueList` generic class and build on top of the generic CRUD operations from the class. | Reduces amount of repeated code as all the lists of data essentially perform the same functions.                                                                               | Generics can be harder to comprehend, thus making it harder for other programmers to understand and use the component. |
| Option 2: Do not extract any common functionalities                                                                                                                                                                                              | Easier for programmers to work on each code related to each data item completely separately, and implement methods specific to the data item in a more straightforward manner. | Violates the Don't Repeat Yourself principle as there will be a lot of repeated CRUD operations.                       |

<br>Reason for choosing Option 1:

Following the Don't Repeat Yourself design principle will allow for more abstraction and less duplication in the code,
which facilitates future extensions and reduce effort in maintenance and testing by reducing repeated code. 

### **4.2. Patient Management Features**

(Contributed by Thuta Htun Wai)

Baymax allows the user to manage patient information. A user can only deal with a single patient at any time. i.e. Only
a single patient's information can be managed at one time. A user can:

* Add a new patient
* Delete an existing patient
* Edit a patient's details
* Add a remark to a patient
* List all the patients in the system
* Find a patient by using a keyword from his/her name

#### 4.2.1. Rationale

The Patient Management Features are included in Baymax because it is one of the core features of the application.
If the user wants to keep track of the patient's information, he/she has to record the details
of the patient and be able to look up a patient in the system easily.

#### 4.2.2. Current Implementation

The `patient` package in the `Model` component contains the necessary information related to a patient.
The current implementation of the Patient Management Features allows the user to keep track of a list of patients in the appointment book.

In this section, we will outline the `findpatient` command from the Patient Management Features which is summarised by the Activity Diagram in Figure 9 below.

The parameters of the `findpatient` command are keywords in the patient's name that the user wants to search for. 
E.g. `findpatient alex` will search and list all patients whose name has the word `alex`. 

![FindPatientActivityDiagram](images/FindPatientActivityDiagram.png)<br>
Figure 9. Workflow of a `findpatient` command

When the user enters the `findpatient` command to search for a patient, the user input command undergoes the same command parsing as described in [Section 3.3, “Logic component”](#33-logic-component).
During the parsing, a predicate is created. This predicate checks if a given Patient contains the user input keywords. The `FindPatientCommand` will then receive this predicate when it is created.

The following steps will describe the execution of the `FindPatientCommand` in detail, assuming that no error is encountered.

1. When the `execute()` method of the `FindActivityCommand` is called, the `ModelManager`’s `updateFilteredPatientList()` method is called.
2. The `ModelManager` then proceeds to call the `setPredicate()` method of the `FilteredList<Patient>`.
3. The `FilteredList<Patient>` will then update its filtered list of patients to contain only patients that fulfil the given predicate.
4. The Ui component will detect this change and update the GUI.
5. If the above steps are all successful, the `FindPatientCommand` will then create a CommandResult object and return the result.

The *Sequence Diagram* below summarises the aforementioned steps.

![FindPatientSequenceDiagram](images/FindPatientSequenceDiagram.png)<br>
Figure . Execution of the `FindPatientCommand`

**Note**:

1. The lifeline for the `FindPatientCommand` should end at the destroy mark (X). However, due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.
2. This sequence diagram does not take into consideration the possible exceptions which might occur during the `FindPatientCommand` execution.


The following table shows the commands related to managing a patient's details.<br>

| Command | Purpose
| --------- | ------------------------------------------
| `addpatient` | Adds a new patient.
| `deletepatient` | Deletes a patient.
| `listpatients` | Lists all patients.
| `editpatient` | Edits a patient's details.
| `findpatient` | Finds a patient with the given keyword in his/her name.
| `remark` | Adds/Edits the remark of a patient.

#### 4.2.3. Design Consideration

**Aspect: Find matching names using substrings (E.g. ale) vs using exact words (E.g. alex)**

|                                               | Pros                                                             | Cons                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Option 1 (Current Choice): Match by substring | Shorter keywords to type, therefore increases user typing speed. | Lower accuracy. The filtered list is longer and takes longer time to find the patient you are looking for.                                  |
| Option 2: Match by the exact word             | Higher accuracy.                                                 | Longer names are harder for the user to find the exact match. It is also difficult for the user to remember and type out the exact keyword. |

<br>Reason for choosing Option 1:

* Option 1 is more flexible for the user. If the user wants higher accuracy, he/she can type longer keywords to filter out more patients. 
 
**Aspect: Whether the Patient class should contain a list of Appointments**

| Option 1 (Current Choice): Patient class does not contain a list of Appointments. | Avoids cyclic dependency since the Appointment class already contains a Patient.   <br><br>Reduces overhead from having to update 2 lists (1 from ModelManager and 1 from the Patient class)  . | More tedious to find a list of appointments belonging to a specific patient and there is more overhead from  having to filter the appointment list by a predicate.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Option 2: Patient class will contain a list of Appointments.                      | A list of appointment belonging to a specific patient can be directly retrieved from the patient object  which is faster than having the extra step to filter the list.                         | Cyclic dependency is present. (Patient and Appointment depend on each other).   <br><br>Whenever any update is made to the list of appointments, such as adding a new appointment or editing an appointment, extra overhead is incurred from processing both the lists inside the ModelManager and the Patient class. |

<br>Reason for choosing Option 1:

* Option 1 follows good coding principles by avoiding cyclic dependency.

* When the list of appointments increase in size, Option 1 performs better because Baymax involves a lot of "update/set"
operations such as marking an appointment as done/missed and adding/editing an appointment.

### **4.3 Appointment Manager**
(Contributed by Shi Hui Ling & Reuben Teng)

Scheduling, viewing, and otherwise dealing with appointments is a key feature area for Baymax. `AppointmentManager` maintains a `UniqueList` of all `Appointment`s in the app, and executes the logic of most appointment commands. 

`AppointmentManager` contains the methods necessary to operate on the `UniqueList` of `Appointment`s. These include:
 1. Adding an appointment
 2. Editing an appointment
 3. Deleting an appointment
 4. Finding a specific appointment by `Patient` and `DateTime`
 5. Sorting the list of appointments
 
These methods are used by the `AppointmentCommand` classes to execute their logic.

The *Object Diagram* below summarises the interactions between AppointmentManager and Appointments.

![AppointmentManagerObjectDiagram](images/AppointmentObjectDiagram.png)<br>
Figure . Object diagram of `AppointmentManager`


#### 4.3.1 Rationale

The `AppointmentManager` class contains a summary of all the "back-end" logic of appointment commands on the app's `UniqueList` of `Appointment`s. This follows the SRP, as everything related to the execution of appointment commands can be found here. This also forces the customising of code to fit exactly the purposes needed for appointment commands, even if the methods simply call a `UniqueList` method that fulfills the exact purpose.

#### 4.3.2. Current Implementation

Makes use of many methods from `UniqueList`, e.g. `add`, `setElement`, `remove`, `sort`.

#### 4.3.3. Design Consideration

**Aspect 1: `cancel` Command** 
 
For this command, we only required the specifying of `DateTime` of the appointment, and we allowed specifying the `Patient` by `name`, `nric`, or `index` (in the currently displayed list). This is to ensure that receptionists can opt for either a more intuitive way to specify a `Patient` (by `name` or `index`) or a quicker and more "guaranteed correct" way (by `nric`).

Additionally, we only require matching of `DateTime` and `Patient` of appointment as no two appointments should have those two fields exactly the same. By reducing the number of arguments needed for the command, we make the command more succinct and easy to use for receptionists. It is also easier implementation-wise.

**Aspect 2: `nric` field**

To ensure that `Appointment`s are json serialisable for `Storage` in the same way as `Patient`s, all fields of the `Appointment` class have to be serialisable. To achieve this, an `nric` field is added to each `Patient` to uniquely identify patients currently stored in the system. When serialising an `Appointment`, the patient field stores the `nric` string of the patient instead, and when reading an `Appointment` from memory a lookup is performed on the existing list of patients before a valid `Appointment` object is created containing an existing Patient object.

**Aspect 3: Marking of Appointment `status` attribute**

Automated the marking of an `Appointment` as `DONE` after the deadline has passed, and giving receptionists the ability to mark `Appointment`s as missed.

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Pros                                                                                                     | Cons                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Option 1: Periodically check the `Datetime` of an `Appointment` that is still marked  `UPCOMING` against the current `Datetime`, marking it as `DONE` if the current  `Datetime` is after that of the `Appointment` . | Keeps stored data perpetually up-to-date.                                                                | Constant comparision become computationally intensive when there are many  `UPCOMING` appointments. |
| Option 2 (Current Choice): Check `Datetime` of `Appointment` against current `Datetime`  only when `getStatus()` method is called.                                                                                    | Computation is performed when the value of  `status` is needed, resulting in reduced computational cost. | Architecture becomes less intuitive as `status` is no longer stored.                                |

<br>Reason for choosing Option 2:

While the architecture might become less intuitive, computing `status` only when needed is much more efficient.

**Aspect 4: Backdated `Appointment`s**

To provide flexibility for users, `Appointment`s beforSe the current `Datetime` can be added to Baymax. They are marked as `DONE` automatically, but receptionist will be able to change the status to `MISSED` as well.

Such appointments are marked `DONE` automatically as it is assumed that it is more important for receptionists to know what `Appointment`s patients have gone for, and thus it is more likely for them to be backdated.

### **4.4 Calendar Feature**
(Contributed by Li Jianhan & Kaitlyn Ng)

Baymax allows the user to manage appointments using a built-in calendar.
The calendar brings greater convenience to the user by showing them what days are available in a month.
It is also coupled with a schedule view that can be accessed by entering the `day` command, which shows the user
all appointments on the chosen day, laid out chronologically on a timeline.

#### 4.4.1 Rationale

The Calendar feature is included in Baymax because it offers greater convenience in terms of viewing and adding
appointments. The calendar view and schedule view offer a quick Month and Day overview of all the appointments
respectively, such that the user can quickly tell at a glance which days or timings are booked and which are free.

The Calendar feature also helps to shorten commands by allowing the user to only specify
the time of appointments, as the date can be inferred from the calendar. For example, in the Calendar 
Manager, a user can set a custom year, month and day. This influences the execution of the `addappt` command shown 
in the sequence diagram below. In this example, suppose the user has set year to 2020, 
month to February and day to 1, he can directly enter an `addappt` command that adds an appointment to 1, 
February, 2020 without having to enter a date into the command fields. This makes the command shorter, more convenient
and more user-friendly.

Below is an example of the sequence diagram when the user executes an AddAppointment command without specifying a date.
The diagram illustrates how the CalendarManager is used to automatically set the date of the appointment.

![AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram](images/AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)<br>
Figure X. Execution of an AddAppointment command with the help of CalendarManager

#### 4.4.2. Current Implementation
The `CalendarManager` class in the `Model` component contains an `AppointmentCalendar` object, storing the currently set 
year, month and day. Note that the year, month and day attributes may not necessarily be storing the 
present year, month and day. When a user sets the year, month and day, the `Logic` Component parses the user input and
constructs a YearCommand, MonthCommand and DayCommand respectively. Upon execution, the `ModelManager` calls upon the
`CalendarManager` to update the year, month and day within the `AppointmentCalendar`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `Logic` component interacts with the `ModelManager` to influence the
`year` value in the `AppointmentCalendar` managed by the `CalendarManager`.

| Option 1 (Current Choice): New AppointmentCalendar class in the model to store the day, month, year | Allows for greater modularity. Whenever the Logic component requests for the day/month/year, the ModelManager can directly pass it a single AppointmentCalendar object,  making it more extensible at it does not overcomplicate the CalendarManager class. <br><br> By hiding the year, month and day in the AppointmentCalendar class, it adheres to the OOP principle of Encapsulation, as the CalendarManager only needs to be aware of the AppointmentCalendar object and not what it contains. | Harder to implement (a new class is needed).                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Option 2: Store the day, month and year directly inside the CalendarManager                         | Simpler to implement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | More cumbersome to pass around three objects (Year, Month and Day) compared to a single AppointmentCalendar object.  If more features were to be implemented in the CalendarManager, it will quickly clutter up the CalendarManager class. |

<br>Reason for choosing Option 1: 

* Option 1 follows good coding principles by adhering to the principle of encapsulation.

* As two UI views (`ScheduleView` and `CalendarView`) depend on the `AppointmentCalendar`, abstracting the contents of 
  the Calendar out into an `AppointmentCalendar` class that is managed by the `CalendarManager` makes more intuitive
  sense, as the UI views can now just observe for changes to the `AppointmentCalendar` by the manager and update the
  views accordingly.

* Abbreviation for User Interface, representing the point of human-computer interaction and communication.

#### *API*
* Abbreviation for Application Programming Interface. It defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries.

#### *OOP*
* Abbreviation Object-Oriented Programming, in which programmers organise software design around data (objects), rather than functions and logic.

#### *CLI*
* Abbreviation for Command Line Interface, referring to an interface which accepts user inputs and commands in the form of text.

#### *MSS*
* Abbreviation for Main Success Scenario, describing the most straightforward interaction for a given use case, which assumes that nothing goes wrong.

#### *OS*
* Abbreviation Operating System, referring to mainstream Operating Systems Windows, Linux, OS-X.

#### *json*
* Short for JavaScript Object Notation, referring to a memory-cheap format for storing and transporting data.

#### *csv*
* Abbreviation for Comma-Separated Values, referring to a plain text file with a list of data, which each value within the data separated by a comma.

#### *Private contact detail*
* A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others.

#### *Boilerplate code*
* Code that is reused without significant changes. Usually a sign of poor coding practices.

#### *Separation of Concerns principle*
* Principle of separating code into different sections, with each section handling a different concern. This allows for
  a more modular approach to implementation, with changes to one section not affecting another.
  
#### *Generics*
* Generic classes, interfaces and methods are used to allow programmers to perform similar operations on multiple data types.
